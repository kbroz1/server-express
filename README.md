# Server Express

## My Favorites Folder

Here is an overview of myFavorites folder, which includes 4 HTML files and 1 javascript file. In my server file, you will notice that I used Node routes in order to route the user to different HTML pages that include my favorite movies, food, framework, and a portfolio.
